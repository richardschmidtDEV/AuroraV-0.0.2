# Aurora

This is a Prototype off a project of mine which is currently under development.
In the end it's gonna be a OffSec Terminal Emulator with a lot of features.

To run the Project just execute the main.py like this: python3 /path/to/main.py/main.py

Currently a lot of features are standalone and not yet integrated in the main.py but for testing you can of the main.py the execute the tool you want to test.
Keep in mind not all tools are finished, tested and implemented so therefore bugs can occur.
